ABOUT CITATION BUILDER LIBRARY
--------------------------------------- 

The Citation Builder library is a small backend PHP library to format citations according to APA6 or MLA7.

This project is a fork of http://github.com/phpforfree/citationbuilder which has been stripped down to remove the front-end code.
